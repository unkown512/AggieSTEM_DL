Meeting Summary - 10/31/2019 at 1:15 PM Central 

Reviewed the first iteration of the manage users page and updates on the previous views for user profile, sign up, and sign in pages.
Each page checked out very positively with the customer and required very minimal changes. The signup page will include a position role
such as researcher, senior doc, and director. The next iteration will include the manage groups view and the fully integrated database 
for full testing.
